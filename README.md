# Mining Station Alpha

Game Description Short: You, the lonely robot, are stranded on a mining asteroid far from home. Mine ore, fight spiders, and research a way to get off the asteroid before you perish!

Game Description Long: Your (unseen) team has crash landed on a mining asteroid. Fearing loss of life, they all entered cryosleep and activated you, a fragment of the Shipâ€™s AI to research a way home and defend the ship from monsters on the asteroid. Many different ores can be mined and smelted such as Copper, Titanium, and Cobalt ores. You must manage your research points, battery life, and distance from the ship to survive on this hostile environment.
